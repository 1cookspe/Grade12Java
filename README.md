# ICS4U-Spencer

A collection of Java projects completed for Grade 12 Computer Science class. Throughout the semester we explored fundamentals such as recursion and classes. A notable project we completed was our own functional version of Photoshop, located <a href="https://github.com/1cookspe/Grade12Java/blob/master/src/edu/hdsb/gwss/cook/u1/Transformer.java">here</a>
All source files can be found under "src" and then "edu/hdsb/gwss/cook", where they are organized into units.
